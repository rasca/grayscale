Grayscale Mode
==============

Smart Grayscale Mode app, better manage the relationship with your smartphone. 

Grayscale Mode is an app to manage the grayscale mode of your smartphone. Most
phones have this option but it's not easily accessible and the surrounding UX
is pretty limited.

This apps works for you, helping you achieve a healthier relationship with your
smartphone by puting you in control.

While Grayscale Mode is on your smartphone looses it's appeal; you look at the
screen and far from catching your eye you think, why am I even looking at this?

Rationale
---------

I intend to scratch an itch of my own with the creation of this app. This is
the first of many ideas I want to try to make my smartphone as healthier as I
can for me.

Grayscale Mode helps me control my screen time and improve my sleep. My phone
(S9) does have a grayscale feature under Digital Wellbeing but it get's in my
way.
